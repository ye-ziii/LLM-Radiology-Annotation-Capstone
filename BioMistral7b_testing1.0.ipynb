RadLex: The Radiological Association of America developed the Radiological Ontology (RadLex) to support radiology information systems. It provides a comprehensive and standardized system for describing radiology exams and their findings . 2. SNOMED CT: The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is a highly detailed ontology used in healthcare information systems. It has been used successfully in a few radiology applications . 3. RadDX: RadDX is an ontology created to accurately represent the clinical imaging reports, for retrieval purposes. It is a subset of RadLex . 4. RadBO (IEO): The Radiology Board Output Ontology (RadBO) is an ontology designed to capture the board-certified radiology report content. It is also developed by the RSNA. 5. eMesLR: The Enhanced Metathesaurus for Laboratory Research (eMesLR) is an ontology developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. This ontology provides controlled vocabularies and relationships to connect radiology and pathology. 6. CaDEnTLO: Computer-Aided Disease Terminologies Linking Ontology (CaDEnTLO) was built to integrate disease symptom ontology and diagnostic ontology to create a richer diagnostic metadata set from structured or unstructured text.</s>'"

Also unchanged is linear enhancement which extends through the middle of this syringohydromyelia. The enhancing tissue may represent residual tumor, granulation or a combination of both.2. The cord becomes very thin between C7 and T1. At T2, there is a loculated cystic component within the cord which, although not convincingly changed relative to the prior examination from 2013, has increased in size from older studies. The margins of this cyst, and particularly the inferior margin, do enhance.3. Fatty marrow replacement compatible with radiation therapy is seen from C2 through T7. Marrow signal is otherwise unremarkable.4. Scattered disk herniations and degenerative findings as above.5. Atrophy of the right kidney.   \n",

Output should be in the dictionary format where the keys are those 6 categories, and values are corresponding entities extracted from the report or None if missing.</s>  \n",

Also unchanged is linear enhancement which extends through the middle of this syringohydromyelia. The enhancing tissue may represent residual tumor, granulation or a combination of both.2. The cord becomes very thin between C7 and T1. At T2, there is a loculated cystic component within the cord which, although not convincingly changed relative to the prior examination from 2013, has increased in size from older studies. The margins of this cyst, and particularly the inferior margin, do enhance.3. Fatty marrow replacement compatible with radiation therapy is seen from C2 through T7.

Also unchanged is linear enhancement which extends through the middle of this syringohydromyelia. The enhancing tissue may represent residual tumor, granulation or a combination of both.2. The cord becomes very thin between C7 and T1. At T2, there is a loculated cystic component within the cord which, although not convincingly changed relative to the prior examination from 2013, has increased in size from older studies.
